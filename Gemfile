# Pry is a powerful alternative to the standard IRB shell for Ruby. It is
# written from scratch to provide a number of advanced features, including:
#   - Source code browsing (including core C source with the pry-doc gem)
#   - Documentation browsing
#   - Live help system
#   - Open methods in editors (edit Class#method)
#   - Syntax highlighting
#   - Command shell integration (start editors, run git, and rake from within
#     Pry)
#   - Gist integration
#   - Navigation around state (cd, ls and friends)
#   - Runtime invocation (use Pry as a developer console or debugger)
#   - Exotic object support (BasicObject instances, IClasses, ...)
#   - A powerful and flexible command system
#   - Ability to view and replay history
#   - Many convenience commands inspired by IPython, Smalltalk and other
#     advanced REPLs
#   - A wide-range number of plugins that provide remote sessions, full
#     debugging functionality, and more
