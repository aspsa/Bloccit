# Checkpoint #58 - Public Profiles
#
# This is a good example for using a feature spec because we have a clear user story: "As a Visitor, I want to see users' information, posts, and comments on a profile page".
#
# The spec will lay out our expectations for this flow, and guide us through the process of building the functionality which satisfies those expectations.

    # Assignment #58 - Public Profiles
    #
    # At the end of this checkpoint, we uncovered an error. To ensure it doesn't happen again write a second spec in profiles_spec.rb to test a user visiting their own profile.
    #
    # The spec's expectations (inside the it block) should be identical to those for the "not signed in" case.
    #
    # The spec should have an additional before block in which @user is signed in before visiting their profile page.
    #   - You should not need to make any changes outside of the spec folder.
    #
    # Do not use Devise::TestHelpers to sign in your user. They don't work in feature specs. Instead, read How To: Test with Capybara and follow the instructions to include the test helpers from Warden, the authentication framework on which Devise is built.
    #
    # After including the helpers and starting Warden in test mode, login_as your authenticated user in a before block.
    #
    # Give login_as a second argument of scope: :user, as per the article's instructions.
    #
    # Once you've successfully signed in the user, run profiles_spec.rb to confirm your new test passes.
