    #   - Read the Factory Girl getting started guide.
    #
    #   - Make a user_with_post_and_comment factory in the spec/factories/user.rb file.
    #
    #   - Define the factory within the factory :user definition, so you don't have to repeat most of the attribute definitions.
    #       -- Because of the direction of associations, comments and posts have
    #          user IDs, not the other way around. Therefore, use an after
    #          (:build).
    #
    #   - Use the user_with_post_and_comment factory in your users specs.
