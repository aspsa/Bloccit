# Checkpoint #40 - Topics and Posts
#
# Update 'post.rb' and 'topic.rb' to reflect the
# 'topic_id' association.
class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
    # Checkpoint #51 - Destroy
    #
    # Just like with topics, think about the implications of deleting a post. You know that comments belong to to posts, so let's modify post.rb to handle this
    # Note that because comments are dependent on posts and posts are dependent on topics, if you delete a topic, it will remove its associated posts and those posts' associated comments.
    #
    # has_many :comments
    has_many :comments, dependent: :destroy
    belongs_to :user
    
    # Checkpoint #53 - Voting
    #
    # Modify post.rb to call post.votes. A Vote should not exist without a Post, so we need to account for posts being destroyed.
    #
    # We added similar code to 'ost.rb' for comments.
    has_many :votes, dependent: :destroy
    
    # Checkpoint #40 - Topics and Posts
    belongs_to :topic
    
    # Checkpoint #38 - Associations
    #default_scope { order('created_at DESC') }
    #
    # Checkpoint #53 - Voting
    #
    # Now that we have a rank that's determined by an algorithm, we'll employ it in the default_scope, so that posts are ordered by rank by default. Since we want the largest rank numbers displayed first, we'll use descending (DESC) order. Update the current default_scope declaration with 'rank DESC'
    default_scope { order('rank DESC') }
    
    # Checkpoint #42 - Validating Posts
    #
    # Validate the Post model with the following rules:
    #   A Post must have at least five characters in the title;
    #   A Post must have at least 20 characters in the body;
    #   A Post must have an associated topic and user.
    validates :title, length: { minimum: 5 }, presence: true
    validates :body, length: { minimum: 20 }, presence: true

    # Checkpoint #53 - Voting
    #
    # Because of Devise, however, creating a user for our test post isn't a trivial task, so don't add the code directly above. We'll discuss how to create a test user in the next checkpoint. For now, circumvent the issue by commenting the validations in post.rb.
    #
    # Here is the code that is suggested not to be added to 'post_spec.rb'.
    #
    #   before do
    #       user = User.create
    #       topic = Topic.create
    #       @post = Post.create(title: 'Post title', body: 'Post bodies must be
    #           pretty long.', user: user, topic: topic)
    #
    # validates :topic, presence: true
    # validates :user, presence: true
    #
    # Add the following 'up_votes' method to your post.rb file.
    # Remember 'votes' in this code is an implied 'self.votes'.
    #
    # Before continuing, add a similar 'down_votes' method to 'post.rb', and a 'points' method, which uses ActiveRecord's 'sum' method to add up the value of all the given post's votes.
    # You can pass a symbol of an attribute to sum, to tell it what to sum in the collection.
    def up_votes
        votes.where(value: 1).count
    end
    
    def down_votes
        votes.where(value: -1).count
    end
    
    def points
       votes.sum(:value) 
    end
    
    # Checkpoint #53 - Voting
    #
    # The 'after_save' method will run update_post every time a vote is saved. The 'update_post' method calls a method named 'update_rank' on a vote's post object. We haven't created 'update_rank' yet, so 'open post.rb' and do that now.
    #
    # Note the two uses of implied 'self' -- 'created_at' and 'update_attribute'.
    #
    # People have very different takes on ranking algorithms. Some are very complex and some are very simple. The Bloccit algorithm is an attempt at a simple yet useful ranking tool. Since you created the rank attribute as a float, you'll have the flexibility needed to tinker with it. Try searching for the ranking algorithms that Hacker News or Reddit use.
    def update_rank
       age_in_days = (created_at - Time.new(1970,1,1)) / (60 * 60 * 24) # 1 day in seconds
       new_rank = points + age_in_days
       
       update_attribute(:rank, new_rank)
