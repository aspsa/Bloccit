# Checkpoint #40 - Topics and Posts
#
# The Topics controller file was created by executing the following statement
# in the IRB:
#     'rails g controller topics index new show edit'
#
# The auto-generated stubs are filled in; the 'create' and 'update' methods
# are added next.

    # Checkpoint #45 - Pagination
    #
    # Before we begin, think about where you might start implementing
    # 'will_paginate'. You know that the goal is to separate out the collections
    # of topics and posts, so we should start where we collect topics and posts
    # for display.
    #
    # We call paginate on the collection of posts and topics, and pass it some
    # arguments that will dictate how the pagination will eventually render. In
    # this case, we instruct paginate to select a subset of 10 posts / topics
    # per page, starting on page number params[:page].
    #
    # @topics = Topic.all
    #
    # Assignment #45 - Pagination
    #
    # 'will_paginate' works well if we have a few hundred posts, but what if
    # Bloccit goes viral and receives thousands of posts?
    #   - nstead of displaying 10 posts per page, display 100 post per page by
    # using the per_page(num) method in 'TopicsController#show'.
    #
    # @topics = Topic.paginate(page: params[:page], per_page: 10)
    #
    # @topics = Topic.paginate(page: params[:page], per_page: 100)
    #
    # Use the default model based upon the following direction in the
    # assignment
    #   - 'will_paginate' also allows you to set the number of items per page
    #     in the model. Use the 'per_page=(num)'' method in Topic to display 50
    #     topics per page. You'll need to modify 'TopicsController' to use the
    #     model default.
    #
    # (See the 'Topic' model for the pagination instructions.)
