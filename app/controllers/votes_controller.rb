# Checkpoint #53 - Voting
#
# There's no need to use the Rails controller generator, because we don't need any views associated with the 'votes_controller.rb'. Instead, create a new file in the 'app/controllers/'' directory and add the 'up_vote' method that you reference in 'routes.rb'.
#
# The method should find the relevant vote if one already exists for that post and the current_user. It should update the vote if it exists, and create a new one if not.
#
# You could implement a nearly identical method for down_vote, but that wouldn't be DRY. When you have separate methods with a lot of overlapping code, you should think of a DRYer way to write the methods. In this case, we'll use a 'before_action' to setup the instance variables needed for both 'up_vote' and 'down_vote'. Declare a 'before_action' at the top of 'votes_controller.rb', then define that private method.
#
# There's one other part of our old 'up_vote' method that was bothersome -- the conditional logic needed to either update or create a vote value. Let's extract that logic out into a separate method for updating vote values. By doing this, we keep 'up_vote' and 'down_vote' very simple. Add another private method named 'update_vote!'.
#
# Because we need to authorize an actual Vote object before it is saved to a database, the else section of the method has been expanded. Instead of a single call to create, the Vote object is first initialized with 'build', then authorized, and finally stored in a database using 'save'.
