  # We set three different headers to enable threading in different email clients.

    # You'll notice that we define three instance variables to equal local variables, but then never use them. What's going on?
    #
    # ActionMailer follows a similar pattern to Rails controllers: You can define instance variables that will be available to your "view" - the content sent in the email.

    # The most important line in this method is the last. The mail method takes a hash of mail-relevant information - the subject, the to address, the from (we're using the default), and any cc or bcc information you want - and prepares the email to be sent.
