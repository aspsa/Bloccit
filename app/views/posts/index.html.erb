    Instance variables created in a controller method are available in its
    associated view. That is, since '@posts' was created and assigned in the
    'index' method, you can use it in the 'index' view.

        argument, the 'link_to' method will detect the object, parst its id, and
        create the path using the id. Using this shortcut, we can simplify our
        page.
