    Checkpoint #59 - Popular Posts
    
    Now that we've nested the rest of our post views under topics, let's create the top-level Posts controller and routes.
    
    Note that we don't need the render partial: 'posts/post' syntax, because the partial is within the index view's parent directory.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-8">
        <h1>Popular</h1>
        <p class="lead">Active posts this week</p>
        <%= render @posts %>
        <%= will_paginate @posts %>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-4">
        
    </div>
</div>
