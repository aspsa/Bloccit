            Checkpoint #42 - Validating Posts
            
            Now that you have some new errors that can be raised by the
            validates methods (see 'post.rb'), change the 'Post' views
            to display these errors when they occur. Since these changes
            affect both the 'new' and 'edit' views, this is a good time
            to demonstrate using partials to make our views DRY.
            
            Partials are fragments of template code, which are used in
            views. Partials are called with the 'render' method. Rendering
            a partial is essentially copying and pasting view code from
            another file.
            
            You've called a partial in 'posts#edit', but currently, this
            partial file doesn't exist. To get this partial render working,
            we need to create the specified 'form' file, and fill it with
            the contents we just cut out.
            
            Note: This checkpoint requires commenting out the code
            added in Checkpoint #40.
