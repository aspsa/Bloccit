/*
    Checkpoint #61 - Creating with Ajax
    
    Create app/views/comments/create.js.erb, and consider the following pseudo code for your view:

        if the comment is valid
          add the comment to the list of comments
        else
          render an error on the form
        end
        
    If a comment is valid by the time the view is rendered, it will have already been saved in the controller, so we don't need to save it here.
    
    Showing a new comment will require a call to render an updated comments collection, or the comment form. This can be done from within our js.erb file using escape_javascript, which will make sure the HTML generated by the render is generated properly on the Ajax response.

    Refer to the Rails docs for more details on escape_javascript.
    
    Using our pseudo-code as a guide, use the valid? method, along with escape_javascript to create a new comment unobtrusively.
